# Kotlin Playground

This project contains examples and concepts of the Kotlin language which I document here while on my way to bridge the gap between Java and Kotlin.

## Background

The best way to learn a new programming language is through side projects. A couple of months ago I started a new project – [Rainy Day Post](https://www.rainydaypost.tech) – and for it I chose to explore Kotlin. As a long-time Java developer (15+ years now), I decided to follow a more systematic approach to learning other languages.

## Structure

The project is structured in modules. Every module contains a specific concept or a feature of the language. In every module there's a README.md which will describe the contents of the module – which features and concepts it illustrates, along with detailed explanations about the more tricky parts.

## Why it might be helpful to you too?

For me this project will be a playground, where I test new concepts as I learn them. It will also be a reference for Kotlin syntax, features, idioms etc.
