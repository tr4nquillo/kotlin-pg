# Kotlin Playground

This project contains examples and concepts of the Kotlin language which I document here while on my way to bridge the gap between Java and Kotlin.

## Background

The best way to learn a new programming language is through side projects. A couple of months ago I started a new project – [Rainy Day Post](https://www.rainydaypost.tech) – and for it I chose to explore Kotlin. As a long-time Java developer (15+ years now), I decided to follow a more systematic approach to learning other languages.

## Structure

The project is structured in modules. Every module contains a specific concept or a feature of the language. In every module there's a README.md which will describe the contents of the module – which features and concepts it illustrates, along with detailed explanations about the more tricky parts.

## Why it might be helpful to you too?

For me, this project is a playground where I experiment with new Kotlin concepts as I learn them. It’s also a handy reference for syntax, features, and idioms. Since I won’t be focused on my side project exclusively, I’ll use this repository to track my progress and refresh my knowledge.

If you’re coming from a similar Java background and are curious about Kotlin, you might find this approach useful too. I’d be glad to get tips from experienced Kotlin developers on which concepts to focus on. Feedback is welcome — whether it’s about the structure, examples, or anything else that could make this repository more helpful. Even a quick comment would make my day!
